    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A chocolate brownie, or simply a brownie, is a chocolate baked confection. Brownies come in a variety of forms and may be either fudgy or cakey, depending on their density. Brownies often, but not always, have a glossy "skin" on their upper crust.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3/4 cup (98 grams) all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons (85 grams) unsalted butter</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons light olive oil or canola oil</li>
        <li> ⅓ cups (265 grams) granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup (47 grams) lightly packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2/3 cup (65 grams) unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chocolate chips, optional</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Position an oven rack in the middle of the oven and heat to 325 degrees Fahrenheit. Line the bottom and sides of an 8-inch x 8-inch square baking pan with parchment paper or aluminum foil, leaving an overhang on two opposite sides to help remove the baked brownies from the pan.</li>
        <li>Whisk or sift together the flour and baking powder, and then set aside.</li>
        <li>Add the oil and butter to a medium saucepan. Place over medium-low heat until the butter melts, then turn off the heat. </li>
        <li>While the butter and oil are still warm, stir in the sugars, salt, and vanilla extract until blended.
            Stir in the cocoa powder, and then set aside to cool for five minutes so that the mixture is warm, not hot. The mix will be gritty.</li>
        <li>Add the eggs and egg yolk, and then stir vigorously to blend. The mixture turns from a gritty paste to a shiny pudding-like batter in this step.</li>
        <li>When the batter looks thick and well blended, add the flour and baking powder. If you are adding chocolate chips, add them now. Stir until you no longer see streaks of flour in the batter.</li>
        <li>Spread the brownie batter evenly in the prepared pan.Bake the brownies until the edges look dry and the middle looks slightly underbaked; 35 to 45 minutes. You can test doneness by inserting a toothpick into the center. The brownies are finished baking if it comes out with a few moist crumbs attached.</li>
        <li>Let the brownies cool completely in the pan on a wire rack.</li>
    </ol>
