    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Falafel is a popular Middle Eastern food made with legumes (most often with chickpeas or fava beans) thatâ€™s mixed with herbs, spices, and then deep fried until crisp golden brown on the outside and tender in the middle.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup (250 grams) cooked chickpeas</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon (30 grams) tahini</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon (30 grams) lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon (30 grams) olive oil</li>
        <li>2 to 4 medium garlic cloves</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp ground cumin</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
        <li>2 to 3 cups (480 to 720ml) vegetable oil, for frying</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse the dried chickpeas then place into a large bowl and cover with cool water by about 4 inches. Cover and soak overnight or until the beans triple in size. Drain the soaked chickpeas, rinse, and then pat dry or add to a salad spinner to spin dry.</li>
        <li>Add chickpeas, scallions, garlic, herbs, salt, cumin, coriander, cardamom, cayenne, black pepper, and the baking powder to a bowl of a food processor. Pulse the mixture until very finely minced, but not pureed, scraping the bowl down as necessary.</li>
        <li>Transfer the falafel mix to a bowl and cover. Refrigerate for at least 15 minutes to help the balls hold together when cooking.
        </li>
        <li>Use a tablespoon or small cookie scoop to scoop out 1 1/2 tablespoons of the falafel mix then gently shape it into a ball and place onto a clean plate. Repeat with as many falafel as you plan to cook.</li>
        <li>Add at least 3/4 inch of oil to a deep saucepan, cast iron skillet or Dutch oven.Turn the heat to medium-high and heat the oil to between 350 degrees</li>
        <li>Fry the falafel in batches, placing them gently into the oil and without crowding in the pan, until they are browned on the bottom sides. Using two forks, carefully flip the falafel to brown the other side, 3 1/2 minutes to 4 minutes total.</li>
        <li>Transfer the cooked falafel to a plate lined with paper towel, sprinkle with a little salt, and then repeat with the remaining falafel balls. Serve immediately.</li>
